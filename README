*** Description ***

The wolfSSL embedded SSL library (formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS
library written in ANSI C and targeted for embedded, RTOS, and
resource-constrained environments - primarily because of its small size, speed,
and feature set.  It is commonly used in standard operating environments as well
because of its royalty-free pricing and excellent cross platform support.
wolfSSL supports industry standards up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3
levels, is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers
such as ChaCha20, Curve25519, and Blake2b. User benchmarking and feedback
reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt library. Two versions of the wolfCrypt
cryptography library have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). For additional information, visit the wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ
(https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/) or contact fips@wolfssl.com

*** Why choose wolfSSL? ***

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded SSL solution. Some of
the top reasons include size (typical footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB),
support for the newest standards (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3,
DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.3), current and progressive cipher support
(including stream ciphers), multi-platform, royalty free, and an OpenSSL
compatibility API to ease porting into existing applications which have
previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete feature list, see chapter 4
of the wolfSSL manual. (https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)

*** Notes, Please read ***

Note 1)
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default.  wolfSSL also no longer
supports static key cipher suites with PSK, RSA, or ECDH. This means if you
plan to use TLS cipher suites you must enable DH (DH is on by default), or
enable ECC (ECC is on by default), or you must enable static key cipher suites
with

    WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
    WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
      or
    WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK

though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future
versions of TLS.  They also lower your security by removing PFS.

When compiling ssl.c, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're not
using TLS cipher suites.

Note 2)
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having SSL_connect succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

    wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling wolfSSL_new();. Though it's not recommended.

Note 3)
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with --enable-opensslextra (OPENSSL_EXTRA) or with the macro
NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a single call
hash function. Instead the name WC_SHA, WC_SHA256, WC_SHA384 and WC_SHA512
should be used for the enum name.

# wolfSSL Release 5.8.2 (July 17, 2025)

Release 5.8.2 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * wolfSSL is now GPLv3 instead of GPLv2
            * --enable-heapmath is deprecated
            * MD5 is now disabled by default


PR stands for Pull Request, and PR <NUMBER> references a GitHub pull request number where the code change was added.

## Vulnerabilities

* [Low] There is the potential for a fault injection attack on ECC and Ed25519 verify operations. In versions of wolfSSL 5.7.6 and later the --enable-faultharden option is available to help mitigate against potential fault injection attacks. The mitigation added in wolfSSL version 5.7.6 is to help harden applications relying on the results of the verify operations, such as when used with wolfBoot. If doing ECC or Ed25519 verify operations on a device at risk for fault injection attacks then --enable-faultharden could be used to help mitigate it. Thanks to Kevin from Fraunhofer AISEC for the report.

Hardening option added in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8289


* [High CVE-2025-7395] When using WOLFSSL_SYS_CA_CERTS and WOLFSSL_APPLE_NATIVE_CERT_VALIDATION on an Apple platform, the native trust store verification routine overrides errors produced elsewhere in the wolfSSL certificate verification process including failures due to hostname matching/SNI, OCSP, CRL, etc. This allows any trusted cert chain to override other errors detected during chain verification that should have resulted in termination of the TLS connection. If building wolfSSL on versions after 5.7.6 and before 5.8.2 with use of the system CA support and the apple native cert validation feature enabled on Apple devices (on by default for non-macOS Apple targets when using autotools or CMake) we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Thomas Leong from ExpressVPN for the report.

Fixed in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8833


* [Med. CVE-2025-7394] In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.

Fixed in the following PR’s

https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8898



* [Low CVE-2025-7396] In wolfSSL 5.8.0 the option of hardening the C implementation of Curve25519 private key operations was added with the addition of blinding support (https://www.wolfssl.com/curve25519-blinding-support-added-in-wolfssl-5-8-0/). In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 that blinding support is turned on by default in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519 feature. While the attack would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel observation. Thanks to Arnaud Varillon, Laurent Sauvage, and Allan Delautre from Telecom Paris for the report.

Blinding enabled by default in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8736

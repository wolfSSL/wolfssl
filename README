*** Description ***

The wolfSSL embedded SSL library (formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS
library written in ANSI C and targeted for embedded, RTOS, and
resource-constrained environments - primarily because of its small size, speed,
and feature set.  It is commonly used in standard operating environments as well
because of its royalty-free pricing and excellent cross platform support.
wolfSSL supports industry standards up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3
levels, is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers
such as ChaCha20, Curve25519, and Blake2b. User benchmarking and feedback
reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt library. Two versions of the wolfCrypt
cryptography library have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). For additional information, visit the wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ
(https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/) or contact fips@wolfssl.com

*** Why choose wolfSSL? ***

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded SSL solution. Some of
the top reasons include size (typical footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB),
support for the newest standards (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3,
DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.3), current and progressive cipher support
(including stream ciphers), multi-platform, royalty free, and an OpenSSL
compatibility API to ease porting into existing applications which have
previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete feature list, see chapter 4
of the wolfSSL manual. (https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)

*** Notes, Please read ***

Note 1)
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default.  wolfSSL also no longer
supports static key cipher suites with PSK, RSA, or ECDH. This means if you
plan to use TLS cipher suites you must enable DH (DH is on by default), or
enable ECC (ECC is on by default), or you must enable static key cipher suites
with

    WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
    WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
      or
    WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK

though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future
versions of TLS.  They also lower your security by removing PFS.

When compiling ssl.c, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're not
using TLS cipher suites.

Note 2)
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having SSL_connect succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

    wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling wolfSSL_new();. Though it's not recommended.

Note 3)
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with --enable-opensslextra (OPENSSL_EXTRA) or with the macro
NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a single call
hash function. Instead the name WC_SHA, WC_SHA256, WC_SHA384 and WC_SHA512
should be used for the enum name.

# wolfSSL Release 5.7.2 (July 08, 2024)

Release 5.7.2 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

## Vulnerabilities
* [Medium] CVE-2024-1544
Potential ECDSA nonce side channel attack in versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6 with wc_ecc_sign_hash calls. Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Analyzing the division through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. Thanks to Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck and Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck) for reporting the vulnerability. Details will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24.
Fixed https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7020


* [Medium] CVE-2024-5288
A private key blinding operation, enabled by defining the macro WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY, was added to mitigate a potential row hammer attack on ECC operations. If performing ECC private key operations in an environment where a malicious user could gain fine control over the device and perform row hammer style attacks it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used and to build with WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY defined. Thanks to Kemal Derya, M. Caner Tol, Berk Sunar for the report (Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute)
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7416


* [Low] When parsing a provided maliciously crafted certificate directly using wolfSSL API, outside of a TLS connection, a certificate with an excessively large number of extensions could lead to a potential DoS. There are existing sanity checks during a TLS handshake with wolfSSL which mitigate this issue. Thanks to Bing Shi for the report.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7597

* [Low] CVE-2024-5991
In the function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the Openssl compatibility function X509_check_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. While calling without a NULL terminated string is very uncommon, it is still technically allowed. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non*NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604

* [Medium] CVE-2024-5814
A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7619

* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 response verification bypass issue when a crafted response of length 0 is received. Found with internal testing.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702

* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 revocation bypass with a retry of a TLS connection attempt. A revoked CA certificate could incorrectly be loaded into the trusted signers list and used in a repeat connection attempt. Found with internal testing.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702

*** Description ***

The wolfSSL embedded SSL library (formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS
library written in ANSI C and targeted for embedded, RTOS, and
resource-constrained environments - primarily because of its small size, speed,
and feature set.  It is commonly used in standard operating environments as well
because of its royalty-free pricing and excellent cross platform support.
wolfSSL supports industry standards up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3
levels, is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers
such as ChaCha20, Curve25519, and Blake2b. User benchmarking and feedback
reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt library. Two versions of the wolfCrypt
cryptography library have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). For additional information, visit the wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ
(https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/) or contact fips@wolfssl.com

*** Why choose wolfSSL? ***

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded SSL solution. Some of
the top reasons include size (typical footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB),
support for the newest standards (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3,
DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.3), current and progressive cipher support
(including stream ciphers), multi-platform, royalty free, and an OpenSSL
compatibility API to ease porting into existing applications which have
previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete feature list, see chapter 4
of the wolfSSL manual. (https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)

*** Notes, Please read ***

Note 1)
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default. By default, wolfSSL
disables static key cipher suites that use PSK, RSA, or ECDH without ephemeral
key exchange. Instead, wolfSSL enables cipher suites that provide perfect
forward secrecy (PFS) using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve
(ECC) key exchange, both of which are enabled by default.

If you need to support legacy systems that require static key cipher suites,
you can enable them using one or more of these defines:

WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK

Important: Static key cipher suites reduce security by eliminating perfect
forward secrecy. These cipher suites reuse the same long-term private key for
all session key exchanges. In contrast, PFS-enabled cipher suites (the wolfSSL
default) generate a new ephemeral key for each session, ensuring that
compromising a long-term key cannot decrypt past sessions.

When compiling `ssl.c`, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
`WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES` in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're
not using TLS cipher suites.

Note 2)
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having SSL_connect succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

    wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling wolfSSL_new();. Though it's not recommended.

Note 3)
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with --enable-opensslextra (OPENSSL_EXTRA) or with the macro
NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a single call
hash function. Instead the name WC_SHA, WC_SHA256, WC_SHA384 and WC_SHA512
should be used for the enum name.

PR stands for Pull Request, and PR <NUMBER> references a GitHub pull request number where the code change was added.

## Vulnerabilities
* [Low CVE-2025-12888] Vulnerability in X25519 constant-time cryptographic implementations due to timing side channels introduced by compiler optimizations and CPU architecture limitations, specifically with the Xtensa-based ESP32 chips. If targeting Xtensa it is recommended to use the low memory implementations of X25519, which is now turned on as the default for Xtensa. Thanks to Adrian Cinal for the report. Fixed in PR 9275.


* [Med. CVE-2025-11936] Potential DoS vulnerability due to a memory leak through multiple KeyShareEntry with the same group in malicious TLS 1.3 ClientHello messages. This affects users who are running wolfSSL on the server side with TLS 1.3. Thanks to Jaehun Lee and Kyungmin Bae, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) for the report. Fixed in PR 9117.

* [Low CVE-2025-11935] PSK with PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) downgrades to PSK without PFS during TLS 1.3 handshake. If the client sends a ClientHello that has a key share extension and the server responds with a ServerHello that does not have a key share extension the connection would previously continue on without using PFS. Thanks to Jaehun Lee from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) for the report. Fixed in PR 9112.

* [Low CVE-2025-11934] Signature Algorithm downgrade from ECDSA P521 to P256 during TLS 1.3 handshake. When a client sends ECDSA P521 as the supported signature algorithm the server previously could respond as ECDSA P256 being the accepted signature algorithm and the connection would continue with using ECDSA P256. Thanks to Jaehun Lee from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) for the report. Fixed in PR 9113.


* [Low CVE-2025-11933] DoS Vulnerability in wolfSSL TLS 1.3 CKS extension parsing. Previously duplicate CKS extensions were not rejected leading to a potential memory leak when processing a ClientHello. Thanks to Jaehun Lee from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) for the report. Fixed in PR 9132.


* [Low CVE-2025-11931] Integer Underflow Leads to Out-of-Bounds Access in XChaCha20-Poly1305 Decrypt. This issue is hit specifically with a call to the function wc_XChaCha20Poly1305_Decrypt() which is not used with TLS connections, only from direct calls from an application. Thanks to Luigino Camastra from Aisle Research for the report. Fixed in PR 9223.

* [Low CVE-2025-11932] Timing Side-Channel in PSK Binder Verification. The server previously verified the TLS 1.3 PSK binder using a non-constant time method which could potentially leak information about the PSK binder. Thanks to Luigino Camastra from Aisle Research for the report. Fixed in PR 9223.

* [Low CVE-2025-12889] With TLS 1.2 connections a client can use any digest, specifically a weaker digest, rather than those in the CertificateRequest. Thanks to Jaehun Lee from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) for the report. Fixed in PR 9395

config ZEPHYR_WOLFSSL_MODULE
        bool
config WOLFSSL_PROMPTLESS
        bool
        help
          Symbol to disable the prompt for WOLFSSL selection.
          This symbol may be used internally in a Kconfig tree to hide the
          wolfSSL menu prompt and instead handle the selection of WOLFSSL from
          dependent sub-configurations and thus prevent stuck symbol behavior.


menuconfig WOLFSSL
	bool "wolfSSL Support" if !WOLFSSL_PROMPTLESS
	help
	  This option enables the wolfSSL cryptography library.

if WOLFSSL

choice WOLFSSL_IMPLEMENTATION
	prompt "Select implementation"
	default WOLFSSL_BUILTIN

config WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	bool "Enable wolfSSL integrated sources"
	help
	  Link with local wolfSSL sources instead of external library.

config WOLFSSL_LIBRARY
	bool "Enable wolfSSL external library"
	help
	  This option enables wolfSSL library.

endchoice

config WOLFSSL_SETTINGS_FILE
	string "wolfSSL settings file"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	help
	  Use a specific wolfSSL settings file. The default config file
	  file can be tweaked with Kconfig. The default settings is
	  suitable to communicate with majority of HTTPS servers on the Internet,
	  but has relatively many features enabled. To optimize resources for
	  special TLS usage, use available Kconfig settings, or select an
	  alternative config.

rsource "Kconfig.tls-generic"

config WOLFCRYPT_FIPS
	bool "wolfCrypt FIPS support"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	help
	  Enables FIPS support in wolfCrypt. Requires the wolfSSL FIPS ready
	  download that includes fips.c/fips_test.c.

config WOLFSSL_DTLS
  bool "wolfSSL DTLS support"
  help
    Enable DTLS support

config WOLFSSL_ALPN
  bool "wolfSSL ALPN support"
  help
    Enable ALPN support

config WOLFSSL_PSK
  bool "wolfSSL PSK support"
  help
    Enable PSK support

config WOLFSSL_MAX_FRAGMENT_LEN
  int
  default 3
  range 1 6
  help
    Sets the maximum fragment length wolfSSL will use, values 1-6 correspond to enum values
    WOLFSSL_MFL_* in ssl.h

config WOLFCRYPT_ARMASM
	bool "wolfCrypt ARM Assembly support"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	help
	  wolfCrypt ARM (ARMv8/ARMv7) assembly support for AES, SHA-2, SHA-3,
	  ChaCha20/Poly1305 and Curve25519

config WOLFCRYPT_ARMASM_THUMB2
	bool "wolfCrypt ARM Thumb2 Assembly support"
	depends on WOLFCRYPT_ARMASM
	help
	  Enable Thumb2 assembly optimizations for ARM processors

config WOLFCRYPT_INTELASM
	bool "wolfCrypt Intel Assembly support"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	help
	  wolfCrypt Intel Aassembly support (AVX/AVX2/AESNI)

config WOLFSSL_DEBUG
	bool "wolfSSL debug activation"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	help
	  Enable debugging activation for wolfSSL configuration. If you use
	  wolfSSL/Zephyr integration (e.g. net_app), this will activate debug
	  logging (of the level configured by WOLFSSL_DEBUG_LEVEL).

config WOLFSSL_INSTALL_PATH
	string "wolfSSL install path"
	depends on WOLFSSL_LIBRARY
	help
	  This option holds the path where the wolfSSL libraries and headers are
	  installed. Make sure this option is properly set when WOLFSSL_LIBRARY
	  is enabled otherwise the build will fail.

config APP_LINK_WITH_WOLFSSL
	bool "Link 'app' with WOLFSSL"
	default y
	help
	  Add WOLFSSL header files to the 'app' include path. It may be
	  disabled if the include paths for WOLFSSL are causing aliasing
	  issues for 'app'.

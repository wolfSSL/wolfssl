# wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS Library

The [wolfSSL embedded SSL library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/)
(formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS library written in ANSI C and
targeted for embedded, RTOS, and resource-constrained environments - primarily
because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly used in
standard operating environments as well because of its royalty-free pricing
and excellent cross platform support. wolfSSL supports industry standards up
to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.3, is up to
20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers such as ChaCha20,
Curve25519, Blake2b and Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 groups. User benchmarking and
feedback reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over
OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt cryptography library. Two versions of
wolfCrypt have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). FIPS 140-3 validated (Certificate #4718). For additional
information, visit the [wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/)
or contact fips@wolfssl.com.

## Why Choose wolfSSL?

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded, desktop, mobile, or
enterprise SSL/TLS solution. Some of the top reasons include size (typical
footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB), support for the newest standards
(SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.3),
current and progressive cipher support (including stream ciphers), multi-platform,
royalty free, and an OpenSSL compatibility API to ease porting into existing
applications which have previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete
feature list, see [Chapter 4](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)
of the wolfSSL manual.

## Notes, Please Read

### Note 1
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default. By default, wolfSSL
disables static key cipher suites that use PSK, RSA, or ECDH without ephemeral
key exchange. Instead, wolfSSL enables cipher suites that provide perfect
forward secrecy (PFS) using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve
(ECC) key exchange, both of which are enabled by default.

If you need to support legacy systems that require static key cipher suites,
you can enable them using one or more of these defines:

* `WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH`
* `WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA`
* `WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK`

**Important:** Static key cipher suites reduce security by eliminating perfect
forward secrecy. These cipher suites reuse the same long-term private key for
all session key exchanges. In contrast, PFS-enabled cipher suites (the wolfSSL
default) generate a new ephemeral key for each session, ensuring that
compromising a long-term key cannot decrypt past sessions.

When compiling `ssl.c`, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
`WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES` in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're
not using TLS cipher suites.

### Note 2
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having `SSL_connect` succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, WOLFSSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL);
```

before calling `wolfSSL_new();`. Though it's not recommended.

### Note 3
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with `--enable-opensslextra` (`OPENSSL_EXTRA`) or with the
macro `NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES`. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a
single call hash function. Instead the name `WC_SHA`, `WC_SHA256`, `WC_SHA384` and
`WC_SHA512` should be used for the enum name.

PR stands for Pull Request, and PR (NUMBER) references a GitHub pull request number where the code change was added.

## Vulnerabilities

* [Low] There is the potential for a fault injection attack on ECC and Ed25519 verify operations. In versions of wolfSSL 5.7.6 and later the --enable-faultharden option is available to help mitigate against potential fault injection attacks. The mitigation added in wolfSSL version 5.7.6 is to help harden applications relying on the results of the verify operations, such as when used with wolfBoot. If doing ECC or Ed25519 verify operations on a device at risk for fault injection attacks then --enable-faultharden could be used to help mitigate it. Thanks to Kevin from Fraunhofer AISEC for the report.

Hardening option added in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8289


* [High CVE-2025-7395] When using WOLFSSL_SYS_CA_CERTS and WOLFSSL_APPLE_NATIVE_CERT_VALIDATION on an Apple platform, the native trust store verification routine overrides errors produced elsewhere in the wolfSSL certificate verification process including failures due to hostname matching/SNI, OCSP, CRL, etc. This allows any trusted cert chain to override other errors detected during chain verification that should have resulted in termination of the TLS connection. If building wolfSSL on versions after 5.7.6 and before 5.8.2 with use of the system CA support and the apple native cert validation feature enabled on Apple devices (on by default for non-macOS Apple targets when using autotools or CMake) we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Thomas Leong from ExpressVPN for the report.

Fixed in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8833


* [Med. CVE-2025-7394] In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.

https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8898



* [Low CVE-2025-7396] In wolfSSL 5.8.0 the option of hardening the C implementation of Curve25519 private key operations was added with the addition of blinding support (https://www.wolfssl.com/curve25519-blinding-support-added-in-wolfssl-5-8-0/). In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 that blinding support is turned on by default in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519 feature. While the attack would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel observation. Thanks to Arnaud Varillon, Laurent Sauvage, and Allan Delautre from Telecom Paris for the report.

Blinding enabled by default in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8736

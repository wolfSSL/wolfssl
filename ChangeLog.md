 when performing OCSP requests for intermediate certificates in a certificate
 chain. This affects only TLS 1.3 connections on the server side. It would not
 impact other TLS protocol versions or connections that are not using the
 traditional OCSP implementation. (Fix in pull request 8115)

# wolfSSL Release 5.7.4 (Oct 24, 2024)

Release 5.7.4 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

PR stands for Pull Request, and PR <NUMBER> references a GitHub pull request
 number where the code change was added.


## Vulnerabilities
* [Low] When the OpenSSL compatibility layer is enabled, certificate
 verification behaved differently in wolfSSL than OpenSSL, in the
 X509_STORE_add_cert() and X509_STORE_load_locations() implementations.
 Previously, in cases where an application explicitly loaded an intermediate
 certificate, wolfSSL was verifying only up to that intermediate certificate,
 rather than verifying up to the root CA. This only affects use cases where the
 API is called directly, and does not affect TLS connections. Users that call
 the API X509_STORE_add_cert() or X509_STORE_load_locations() directly in their
 applications are recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used or to have
 additional sanity checks on certificates loaded into the X509_STORE when
 verifying a certificate. (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8087)


## PQC TLS Experimental Build Fix
* When using TLS with post quantum algorithms enabled, the connection uses a
 smaller EC curve than agreed on. Users building with --enable-experimental and
 enabling PQC cipher suites with TLS connections are recommended to update the
 version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Daniel Correa for the report.

# wolfSSL Release 5.7.2 (July 08, 2024)

Release 5.7.2 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

## Vulnerabilities
* [Medium] CVE-2024-1544
Potential ECDSA nonce side channel attack in versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6 with wc_ecc_sign_hash calls. Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Analyzing the division through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. Thanks to Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck and Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck) for reporting the vulnerability. Details will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24.
Fixed https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7020


* [Medium] CVE-2024-5288
A private key blinding operation, enabled by defining the macro WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY, was added to mitigate a potential row hammer attack on ECC operations. If performing ECC private key operations in an environment where a malicious user could gain fine control over the device and perform row hammer style attacks it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used and to build with WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY defined. Thanks to Kemal Derya, M. Caner Tol, Berk Sunar for the report (Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute)
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7416


* [Low] When parsing a provided maliciously crafted certificate directly using wolfSSL API, outside of a TLS connection, a certificate with an excessively large number of extensions could lead to a potential DoS. There are existing sanity checks during a TLS handshake with wolfSSL which mitigate this issue. Thanks to Bing Shi for the report.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7597

* [Low] CVE-2024-5991
In the function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the Openssl compatibility function X509_check_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. While calling without a NULL terminated string is very uncommon, it is still technically allowed. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non*NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604

* [Medium] CVE-2024-5814
A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7619

* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 response verification bypass issue when a crafted response of length 0 is received. Found with internal testing.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702

* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 revocation bypass with a retry of a TLS connection attempt. A revoked CA certificate could incorrectly be loaded into the trusted signers list and used in a repeat connection attempt. Found with internal testing.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702

# wolfSSL Release 5.7.0 (Mar 20, 2024)

Release 5.7.0 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

NOTE: In future releases, --enable-des3 (which is disabled by default) will be insufficient in itself to enable DES3 in TLS cipher suites. A new option, --enable-des3-tls-suites, will need to be supplied in addition.  This option should only be used in backward compatibility scenarios, as it is inherently insecure.

NOTE: This release switches the default ASN.1 parser to the new ASN template code. If the original ASN.1 code is preferred define `WOLFSSL_ASN_ORIGINAL` to use it. See PR #7199.


## Vulnerabilities
* [High] CVE-2024-0901 Potential denial of service and out of bounds read. Affects TLS 1.3 on the server side when accepting a connection from a malicious TLS 1.3 client. If using TLS 1.3 on the server side it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used. Fixed in this GitHub pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7099


* [Med] CVE-2024-1545 Fault Injection vulnerability in RsaPrivateDecryption function that potentially allows an attacker that has access to the same system with a victims process to perform a Rowhammer fault injection. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia)."
Fixed in this GitHub pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7167


* [Med] Fault injection attack with EdDSA signature operations. This affects ed25519 sign operations where the system could be susceptible to Rowhammer attacks. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia).
Fixed in this GitHub pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7212


## New Feature Additions

* Added --enable-experimental configure flag to gate out features that are currently experimental. Now liboqs, kyber, lms, xmss, and dual-alg-certs require the --enable-experimental flag.

# wolfSSL Release 5.6.6 (Dec 19, 2023)

Release 5.6.6 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by 2024

REMINDER: When working with AES Block Cipher algorithms, `wc_AesInit()` should
always be called first to initialize the `Aes` structure, before calling other
Aes API functions. Recently we found several places in our documentation,
comments, and codebase where this pattern was not observed. We have since
fixed this omission in several PRs for this release.

## Vulnerabilities

* [Medium] CVE-2023-6935: After review of the previous RSA timing fix in wolfSSL 5.6.4, additional changes were found to be required. A complete resistant change is delivered in this release. This fix is for the Marvin attack, leading to being able to decrypt a saved TLS connection and potentially forge a signature after probing with a very large number of trial connections. This issue is around RSA decryption and affects the optional static RSA cipher suites on the server side, which are considered weak, not recommended to be used and are off by default in wolfSSL (even with `--enable-all`). Static RSA cipher suites were also removed from the TLS 1.3 protocol and are only present in TLS 1.2 and lower. All padding versions of RSA decrypt are affected since the code under review is outside of the padding processing. Information about the private keys is NOT compromised in affected code. It is recommended to disable static RSA cipher suites and update the version of wolfSSL used if using RSA private decryption alone outside of TLS. Thanks to Hubert Kario for the report. The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6955.

* [Low] CVE-2023-6936: A potential heap overflow read is possible in servers connecting over TLS 1.3 when the optional `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` has been defined. The out of bounds read can occur when a server receives a malicious malformed ClientHello. Users should either discontinue use of `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` on the server side or update versions of wolfSSL to 5.6.6. Thanks to the tlspuffin fuzzer team for the report which was designed and developed by; Lucca Hirschi (Inria, LORIA), Steve Kremer (Inria, LORIA), and Max Ammann (Trail of Bits). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6949.

* [Low] CVE-2024-1543: A side channel vulnerability with AES T-Tables is possible in a very controlled environment where precision sub-cache-line inspection can happen, such as inside an Intel SGX enclave. This can lead to recovery of the AES key. To prevent this type of attack, wolfSSL added an AES bitsliced implementation which can be enabled with the “`--enable-aes-bitsliced`” configure option. Thanks to Florian Sieck, Zhiyuan Zhang, Sebastian Berndt, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Thomas Eisenbarth, and Yuval Yarom for the report (Universities of Lübeck, Melbourne, Adelaide and Bochum). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6854.

* [Low] CVE-2023-6937: wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in a single (D)TLS record do not span key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLS messages using different keys into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then the rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server. This does not compromise key negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a low severity rating. Thanks to Johannes Wilson for the report (Sectra Communications and Linköping University). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7029.

      * Old CyaSSL/CtaoCrypt shim layer was removed in this release (5.6.4)

## Vulnerabilities

* [Medium] A fix was added, but still under review for completeness, for a Bleichenbacher style attack, leading to being able to decrypt a saved TLS connection and potentially forge a signature after probing with a large number of trial connections. This issue is around RSA decryption and affects static RSA cipher suites on the server side, which are not recommended to be used and are off by default. Static RSA cipher suites were also removed from the TLS 1.3 protocol and only present in TLS 1.2 and lower.

# wolfSSL Release 5.6.3 (Jun 16, 2023)

Release 5.6.3 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has 4 bug fixes:

* Fix for setting the atomic macro options introduced in release 5.6.2. This issue affects GNU gcc autoconf builds. The fix resolves a potential mismatch of the generated macros defined in options.h file and the macros used when the wolfSSL library is compiled. In version 5.6.2 this mismatch could result in unstable runtime behavior.
* Fix for invalid suffix error with Windows build using the macro GCM_TABLE_4BIT.
* Improvements to Encrypted Memory support (WC_PROTECT_ENCRYPTED_MEM) implementations for modular exponentiation in SP math-all (sp_int.c) and TFM (tfm.c).
* Improvements to SendAlert for getting output buffer.

# wolfSSL Release 5.6.2 (Jun 09, 2023)

Release 5.6.2 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by 2024

Release 5.6.2 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## Vulnerabilities
* [Low] In cases where a malicious agent could analyze cache timing at a very detailed level, information about the AES key used could be leaked during T/S Box lookups. One such case was shown on RISC-V hardware using the MicroWalk tool (https://github.com/microwalk-project/Microwalk). A hardened version of T/S Box lookups was added in wolfSSL to help mitigate this potential attack and is now on by default with RISC-V builds and can be enabled on other builds if desired by compiling wolfSSL with the macro WOLFSSL_AES_TOUCH_LINES. Thanks to Jan Wichelmann, Christopher Peredy, Florian Sieck, Anna Pätschke, Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck): MAMBO-V: Dynamic Side-Channel Leakage Analysis on RISC-V. Fixed in the following GitHub pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6309
* [High] In previous versions of wolfSSL if a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor a KSE (key share extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a default predictable buffer gets used for the IKM value when generating the session master secret. Using a potentially known IKM value when generating the session master secret key compromises the key generated, allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct it and potentially allowing surreptitious access to or meddling with message contents in the session. This issue does not affect client validation of connected servers, nor expose private key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session when not controlling both sides of the connection. We recommend that TLS 1.3 client side users update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Johannes from Sectra Communications and Linköping University for the report. Fixed in the following GitHub pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6412

# wolfSSL Release 5.5.3 (Nov 2, 2022)

Release 5.5.3 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has the following bug fix:

## Fixes

* Fix for possible buffer zeroization overrun introduced at the end of v5.5.2 release cycle in GitHub pull request 5743 (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5743) and fixed in pull request 5757 (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5757). In the case where a specific memory allocation failed or a hardware fault happened there was the potential for an overrun of 0’s when masking the buffer used for (D)TLS 1.2 and lower operations. (D)TLS 1.3 only and crypto only users are not affected by the issue. This is not related in any way to recent issues reported in OpenSSL.


# wolfSSL Release 5.5.2 (Oct 28, 2022)
Release 5.5.2 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## Vulnerabilities
* [Med] In the case that the WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS macro is set when building wolfSSL, there is a potential heap over read of 5 bytes when handling TLS 1.3 client connections. This heap over read is limited to wolfSSL builds explicitly setting the macro WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS, the feature does not get turned on by any other build options. The macro WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS is intended for debug use only, but if having it enabled in production, users are recommended to disable WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS. Users enabling WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS are recommended to update their version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Lucca Hirschi and Steve Kremer from LORIA, Inria and Max Ammann from Trail of Bits for finding and reporting the bug with the tlspuffin tool developed partly at LORIA and Trail of Bits.

# wolfSSL Release 5.5.0 (Aug 30, 2022)

Note:
** If not free’ing FP_ECC caches per thread by calling wc_ecc_fp_free there is a possible memory leak during TLS 1.3 handshakes which use ECC. Users are urged to confirm they are free’ing FP_ECC caches per thread if enabled to avoid this issue.

Release 5.5.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## Vulnerabilities
* [Low] Fault injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users doing operations with private ECC keys such as server side TLS connections and creating ECC signatures, who also have hardware that could be targeted with a sophisticated Rowhammer attack should update the version of wolfSSL and compile using the macro WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS. Thanks to Yarkin Doroz, Berk Sunar, Koksal Must, Caner Tol, and Kristi Rahman all affiliated with the Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.
* [Low] In wolfSSL version 5.3.0 if compiled with --enable-session-ticket and the client has non-empty session cache, with TLS 1.2 there is the possibility of a man in the middle passing a large session ticket to the client and causing a crash due to an invalid free. There is also the potential for a malicious TLS 1.3 server to crash a client in a similar manner except in TLS 1.3 it is not susceptible to a man in the middle attack. Users on the client side with –enable-session-ticket compiled in and using wolfSSL version 5.3.0 should update their version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report and "LORIA, INRIA, France" for research on tlspuffin.
* [Low] If using wolfSSL_clear to reset a WOLFSSL object (vs the normal wolfSSL_free/wolfSSL_new) it can result in runtime issues. This exists with builds using the wolfSSL compatibility layer (--enable-opnesslextra) and only when the application is making use of wolfSSL_clear instead of SSL_free/SSL_new. In the case of a TLS 1.3 resumption, after continuing to use the WOLFSSH object after having called wolfSSL_clear, an application could crash. It is suggested that users calling wolfSSL_clear update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report and "LORIA, INRIA, France" for research on tlspuffin.
* Potential DoS attack on DTLS 1.2. In the case of receiving a malicious plaintext handshake message at epoch 0 the connection will enter an error state reporting a duplicate message. This affects both server and client side. Users that have DTLS enabled and in use should update their version of wolfSSL to mitigate the potential for a DoS attack.

## New Feature Additions

# wolfSSL Release 5.4.0 (July 11, 2022)

Note:
** Future releases of wolfSSL will turn off TLS 1.1 by default
** Release 5.4.0 made SP math the default math implementation. To make an equivalent build as –disable-fastmath from previous versions of wolfSSL, now requires using the configure option –enable-heapmath instead.

Release 5.4.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## Vulnerabilities
* [High]  Potential for DTLS DoS attack. In wolfSSL versions before 5.4.0 the return-routability check is wrongly skipped in a specific edge case. The check on the return-routability is there for stopping attacks that either consume excessive resources on the server, or try to use the server as an amplifier sending an excessive amount of messages to a victim IP. If using DTLS 1.0/1.2 on the server side users should update to avoid the potential DoS attack. CVE-2022-34293
* [Medium] Ciphertext side channel attack on ECC and DH operations. Users on systems where rogue agents can monitor memory use should update the version of wolfSSL and change private ECC keys. Thanks to Sen Deng from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) for the report.
* [Medium] Public disclosure of a side channel vulnerability that has been fixed since wolfSSL version 5.1.0. When running on AMD there is the potential to leak private key information with ECDSA operations due to a ciphertext side channel attack. Users on AMD doing ECDSA operations with wolfSSL versions less than 5.1.0 should update their wolfSSL version used. Thanks to professor Yinqian Zhang from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), his Ph.D. student Mengyuan Li from The Ohio State University, and his M.S students Sen Deng and Yining Tang from SUStech along with other collaborators; Luca Wilke, Jan Wichelmann and Professor Thomas Eisenbarth from the University of Lubeck, Professor Shuai Wang from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Radu Teodorescu from The Ohio State University, Huibo Wang, Kang Li and Yueqiang Cheng from Baidu Security and Shoumeng Yang from Ant Financial Services Group.

# wolfSSL Release 5.1.1 (Jan 3rd, 2022)
Release 5.1.1 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has a high vulnerability fix:

### Vulnerabilities
* \[High\]  In connections using AES-CBC or DES3 with TLS/DTLS 1.2 or 1.1 the IV being used is not random. Users using wolfSSL version 5.0.0 or 5.1.0 doing TLS/DTLS 1.2 or 1.1 connections, without AEAD only, should update the version of wolfSSL used. (CVE-2022-23408)

# wolfSSL Release 5.1.0 (Dec 27, 2021)
Release 5.1.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

### Vulnerabilities
* \[Low\]  Potential for DoS attack on a wolfSSL client due to processing hello packets of the incorrect side. This affects only connections using TLS v1.2 or less that have also been compromised by a man in the middle attack. Thanks to James Henderson, Mathy Vanhoef, Chris M. Stone, Sam L. Thomas, Nicolas Bailleut, and Tom Chothia (University of Birmingham, KU Leuven, ENS Rennes for the report.
* \[Low\] Client side session resumption issue once the session resumption cache has been filled up. The hijacking of a session resumption has been demonstrated so far with only non verified peer connections. That is where the client is not verifying the server’s CA that it is connecting to. There is the potential though for other cases involving proxies that are verifying the server to be at risk, if using wolfSSL in a case involving proxies use wolfSSL_get1_session and then wolfSSL_SESSION_free when done where possible. If not adding in the session get/free function calls we recommend that users of wolfSSL that are resuming sessions update to the latest version (wolfSSL version 5.1.0 or later). Thanks to the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) for the report.

# wolfSSL Release 5.0.0 (Nov 01, 2021)
Release 5.0.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

### Vulnerabilities
* [\Low\] Hang with DSA signature creation when a specific q value is used in a maliciously crafted key. If a DSA key with an invalid q value of either 1 or 0 was decoded and used for creating a signature, it would result in a hang in wolfSSL. Users that are creating signatures with DSA and are using keys supplied from an outside source are affected.
* [\Low\] Issue with incorrectly validating a certificate that has multiple subject alternative names when given a name constraint. In the case where more than one subject alternative name is used in the certificate, previous versions of wolfSSL could incorrectly validate the certificate. Users verifying certificates with multiple alternative names and name constraints, are recommended to either use the certificate verify callback to check for this case or update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Luiz Angelo Daros de Luca for the report.

# wolfSSL Release 4.8.1 (July 16, 2021)
Release 4.8.1 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has an OCSP vulnerability fix:

### Vulnerabilities
* [High] OCSP verification issue when response is for a certificate with no relation to the chain in question BUT that response contains the NoCheck extension which effectively disables ALL verification of that one cert. Users who should upgrade to 4.8.1 are TLS client users doing OCSP, TLS server users doing mutual auth with OCSP, and CertManager users doing OCSP independent of TLS. Thanks to Jan Nauber, Marco Smeets, Werner Rueschenbaum and Alissa Kim of Volkswagen Infotainment for the report.


# wolfSSL Release 4.8.0 (July 09, 2021)
Release 4.8.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

### Vulnerabilities
* [Low] CVE-2021-37155: OCSP request/response verification issue. In the case that the serial number in the OCSP request differs from the serial number in the OCSP response the error from the comparison was not resulting in a failed verification. We recommend users that have wolfSSL version 4.6.0 and 4.7.0 with OCSP enabled update their version of wolfSSL. Version 4.5.0 and earlier are not affected by this report. Thanks to Rainer Mueller-Amersdorffer, Roee Yankelevsky, Barak Gutman, Hila Cohen and Shoshi Berko (from CYMOTIVE Technologies and CARIAD) for the report.
* [Low] CVE-2021-24116: Side-Channel cache look up vulnerability in base64 PEM decoding for versions of wolfSSL 4.5.0 and earlier. Versions 4.6.0 and up contain a fix and do not need to be updated for this report. If decoding a PEM format private key using version 4.5.0 and older of wolfSSL then we recommend updating the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Florian Sieck, Jan Wichelmann, Sebastian Berndt and Thomas Eisenbarth for the report.

### Vulnerabilities
* [HIGH] CVE-2021-3336: In earlier versions of wolfSSL there exists a potential man in the middle attack on TLS 1.3 clients. Malicious attackers with a privileged network position can impersonate TLS 1.3 servers and bypass authentication. Users that have applications with client side code and have TLS 1.3 turned on, should update to the latest version of wolfSSL. Users that do not have TLS 1.3 turned on, or that are server side only, are NOT affected by this report. For the code change see https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/3676. Thanks to Aina Toky Rasoamanana and Olivier Levillain from Télécom SudParis for the report.
* [LOW] In the case of using custom ECC curves there is the potential for a crafted compressed ECC key that has a custom prime value to cause a hang when imported. This only affects applications that are loading in ECC keys with wolfSSL builds that have compressed ECC keys and custom ECC curves enabled.
* [LOW] With TLS 1.3 authenticated-only ciphers a section of the server hello could contain 16 bytes of uninitialized data when sent to the connected peer. This affects only a specific build of wolfSSL with TLS 1.3 early data enabled and using authenticated-only ciphers with TLS 1.3.

## This release of wolfSSL includes fixes for 6 security vulnerabilities.

wolfSSL version 4.5.0 contains 6 vulnerability fixes: 2 fixes for TLS 1.3,
2 side channel attack mitigations, 1 fix for a potential private key leak
in a specific use case, 1 fix for DTLS.

* In earlier versions of wolfSSL there exists a potential man in the middle
  attack on TLS 1.3 clients. Malicious attackers with a privileged network
  position can impersonate TLS 1.3 servers and bypass authentication. Users
  that have applications with client side code and have TLS 1.3 turned on,
  should update to the latest version of wolfSSL. Users that do not have
  TLS 1.3 turned on, or that are server side only, are NOT affected by this
  report. Thanks to Gerald Doussot from NCC group for the report.
* Denial of service attack on TLS 1.3 servers from repetitively sending
  ChangeCipherSpecs messages. This denial of service results from the
  relatively low effort of sending a ChangeCipherSpecs message versus the
  effort of the server to process that message. Users with TLS 1.3 servers are
  recommended to update to the most recent version of wolfSSL which limits the
  number of TLS 1.3 ChangeCipherSpecs that can be received in order to avoid
  this DoS attack. CVE-2020-12457 was reserved for the report. Thanks to
  Lenny Wang of Tencent Security Xuanwu LAB.
* Potential cache timing attacks on public key operations in builds that are
  not using SP (single precision). Users that have a system where malicious
  agents could execute code on the system, are not using the SP build with
  wolfSSL, and are doing private key operations on the system (such as signing
  with a private key) are recommended to regenerate private keys and update to
  the most recent version of wolfSSL. CVE-2020-15309 is reserved for this
  issue. Thanks to Ida Bruhns from Universität zu Lübeck and Samira Briongos
  from NEC Laboratories Europe for the report.
* When using SGX with EC scalar multiplication the possibility of side-channel
  attacks are present. To mitigate the risk of side channel attacks wolfSSL’s
  single precision EC operations should be used instead. Release 4.5.0 turns
  this on be default now with SGX builds and in previous versions of wolfSSL
  this can be turned on by using the WOLFSSL_SP macros. Thank you to
  Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Cesar Pereida García and Billy Bob Brumley from
  the Network and Information Security Group (NISEC) at Tampere University for
  the report.
* Leak of private key in the case that PEM format private keys are bundled in
  with PEM certificates into a single file. This is due to the
  misclassification of certificate type versus private key type when parsing
  through the PEM file. To be affected, wolfSSL would need to have been built
  with OPENSSL_EXTRA (--enable-opensslextra). Some build variants such as
  --enable-all and --enable-opensslall also turn on this code path, checking
  wolfssl/options.h for OPENSSL_EXTRA will show if the macro was used with the
  build. If having built with the opensslextra enable option and having placed
  PEM certificates with PEM private keys in the same file when loading up the
  certificate file, then we recommend updating wolfSSL for this use case and
  also recommend regenerating any private keys in the file.
* During the handshake, clear application_data messages in epoch 0 are
  processed and returned to the application. Fixed by dropping received
  application_data messages in epoch 0. Thank you to Paul Fiterau of Uppsala
  University and Robert Merget of Ruhr-University Bochum for the report.

##### This release of wolfSSL includes a fix for 6 security vulnerabilities.


A fix for having an additional sanity check when parsing certificate domain names was added. This fix checks that the domain name location index is not past the maximum value before setting it. The reported issue affects users that are parsing certificates and have --enable-opensslextra (macro OPENSSL_EXTRA), or build options that turn this on such as --enable-all, when building wolfSSL. The CVE associated with the fix is CVE-2019-18840.

Fix to set a limit on the maximum size of DTLS handshake messages. By default the RFC allows for handshake message sizes of up to 2^24-1 bytes long but in typical field use cases the handshake messages are not this large. Setting a maximum size limit on the handshake message helps avoid a potential DoS attack due to memory being malloc’d. The new default max size is set to handle a certificate chain length of approximately 9, 2048 bit RSA certificates. This only effects builds that have DTLS turned on and have applications that are using DTLS.

Fix for a potential hang when ECC caching is enabled (off by default) and --enable-fastmath is used. ECC caching is off by default and is turned on in builds that are using --enable-all or --enable-fpecc. This issue does not affect builds that are using the macro WOLFSSL_VALIDATE_ECC_IMPORT which turns on validating all ECC keys that are imported. To fix this potential hang case a sanity check on the input values to the internal invmod function was added.


To fix a potential fault injection attack on a wrapper function for wolfCrypt RSA signature generations an additional sanity check verifying the signature after it’s creation was added. This check is already done automatically in current versions of wolfSSL with TLS connections (internal function call of VerifyRsaSign during TLS state machine). The report only affects users making calls to the wolfCrypt function wc_SignatureGenerateHash and does not affect current TLS use cases. Thanks to Daniel Moghimi (@danielmgmi) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.


Blinding was added for DSA signing operations. The DSA signing uses the BEEA algorithm during modular inversion of the nonce which can potentially leak the nonce through side channels such as cache and power fluctuations. The fix of adding in blinding makes the DSA signing operation more resistant to side channel attacks. Users who have turned on DSA (disabled by default) and are performing signing operations should update. Note that DSA is not used in any TLS connections. Thanks to Daniel Moghimi (@danielmgmi) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.


Fix to add additional side channel cache attack resistance to the internal ECC function wc_ecc_mulmod_ex. This function by default is used with ECDSA signing operations. Users should update if performing ECDSA singing operations (server side ECC TLS connections, mutual authentication on client side) or calling wolfCrypt ECC sign functions and have the potential for outside users to perform sophisticated monitoring of the cache.Thanks to Daniel Moghimi (@danielmgmi) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.

##### This release of wolfSSL includes a fix for 5 security vulnerabilities.

Fix for sanity check on reading TLS 1.3 pre-shared key extension. This fixes a potential for an invalid read when TLS 1.3 and pre-shared keys is enabled. Users without TLS 1.3 enabled are unaffected. Users with TLS 1.3 enabled and HAVE_SESSION_TICKET defined or NO_PSK not defined should update wolfSSL versions. Thanks to Robert Hoerr for the report.

Fix for potential program hang when ocspstapling2 is enabled. This is a moderate level fix that affects users who have ocspstapling2 enabled(off by default) and are on the server side. In parsing a CSR2 (Certificate Status Request v2 ) on the server side, there was the potential for a malformed extension to cause a program hang. Thanks to Robert Hoerr for the report.

Two moderate level fixes involving an ASN.1 over read by one byte. CVE-2019-15651 is for a fix that is due to a potential one byte over read when decoding certificate extensions. CVE-2019-16748 is for a fix on a potential one byte overread with checking certificate signatures. This affects builds that do certificate parsing and do not have the macro NO_SKID defined.Thanks to Yan Jia and the researcher team  from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences for the report.

High level fix for DSA operations involving an attack on recovering DSA private keys. This fix affects users that have DSA enabled and are performing DSA operations (off by default). All users that have DSA enabled and are using DSA keys are advised to regenerate DSA keys and update wolfSSL version. ECDSA is NOT affected by this and TLS code is NOT affected by this issue. Thanks to Ján Jančár for the report.

This release of wolfSSL includes a fix for 1 security vulnerability.

Medium level fix for potential cache attack with a variant of Bleichenbacher’s attack. Earlier versions of wolfSSL leaked PKCS #1 v1.5 padding information during private key decryption that could lead to a potential padding oracle attack. It is recommended that users update to the latest version of wolfSSL if they have RSA cipher suites enabled and have the potential for malicious software to be ran on the same system that is performing RSA operations. Users that have only ECC cipher suites enabled and are not performing RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 Decryption operations are not vulnerable. Also users with TLS 1.3 only connections are not vulnerable to this attack. Thanks to Eyal Ronen (Weizmann Institute), Robert Gillham (University of Adelaide), Daniel Genkin (University of Michigan), Adi Shamir (Weizmann Institute), David Wong (NCC Group), and Yuval Yarom (University of Adelaide and Data61) for the report.

# wolfSSL Release 3.15.3 (6/20/2018)

Release 3.15.3 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

* ECDSA blinding added for hardening against side channel attacks
* Fix for compatibility layer build with no server and no client defined
* Use of optimized Intel assembly instructions on compatible AMD processor
* wolfCrypt Nucleus port additions
* Fix added for MatchDomainName and additional tests added
* Fixes for building with ‘WOLFSSL_ATECC508A’ defined
* Fix for verifying a PKCS7 file in BER format with indefinite size


This release of wolfSSL fixes 2 security vulnerability fixes.

Medium level fix for PRIME + PROBE attack combined with a variant of Lucky 13. Constant time hardening was done to avoid potential cache-based side channel attacks when verifying the MAC on a TLS packet. CBC cipher suites are susceptible on systems where an attacker could gain access and run a parallel program for inspecting caching. Only wolfSSL users that are using TLS/DTLS CBC cipher suites need to update. Users that have only AEAD and stream cipher suites set, or have built with WOLFSSL_MAX_STRENGTH (--enable-maxstrength), are not vulnerable. Thanks to Eyal Ronen, Kenny Paterson, and Adi Shamir for the report.

Medium level fix for a ECDSA side channel attack. wolfSSL is one of over a dozen vendors mentioned in the recent Technical Advisory “ROHNP” by author Ryan Keegan. Only wolfSSL users with long term ECDSA private keys using our fastmath or normal math libraries on systems where attackers can get access to the machine using the ECDSA key need to update.  An attacker gaining access to the system could mount a memory cache side channel attack that could recover the key within a few thousand signatures. wolfSSL users that are not using ECDSA private keys, that are using the single precision math library, or that are using ECDSA offloading do not need to update.

This release of wolfSSL fixes 1 security vulnerability.

wolfSSL is cited in the recent ROBOT Attack by Böck, Somorovsky, and Young.
The paper notes that wolfSSL only gives a weak oracle without a practical
attack but this is still a flaw.  This release contains a fix for this report.
Please note that wolfSSL has static RSA cipher suites disabled by default as
of version 3.6.6 because of the lack of perfect forward secrecy.  Only users
who have explicitly enabled static RSA cipher suites with WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
and use those suites on a host are affected.  More information will be
available on our website at:

https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/security/vulnerabilities.php

If using --enable-intelasm and also using --enable-sha224 or --enable-sha256 there is a known issue with trying to use -fsanitize=address.

This release of wolfSSL fixes 1 low level security vulnerability.

Low level fix for a potential DoS attack on a wolfSSL client. Previously a client would accept many warning alert messages without a limit. This fix puts a limit to the number of warning alert messages received and if this limit is reached a fatal error ALERT_COUNT_E is returned. The max number of warning alerts by default is set to 5 and can be adjusted with the macro WOLFSSL_ALERT_COUNT_MAX. Thanks for the report from Tarun Yadav and Koustav Sadhukhan from Defence Research and Development Organization, INDIA.

# CyaSSL Release 2.7.0 (6/17/2013)

#### Release 2.7.0 CyaSSL has bug fixes and new features including:
- SNI support for client and server
- KEIL MDK-ARM projects
- Wildcard check to domain name match, and Subject altnames are checked too
- Better error messages for certificate verification errors
- Ability to discard session during handshake verify
- More consistent error returns across all APIs
- Ability to unload CAs at the CTX or CertManager level
- Authority subject id support for Certificate matching
- Persistent session cache functionality
- Persistent CA cache functionality
- Client session table lookups to push serverID table to library level
- Camellia support to sniffer
- User controllable settings for DTLS timeout values
- Sniffer fixes for caching long lived sessions
- DTLS reliability enhancements for the handshake
- Better ThreadX support

When compiling with Mingw, libtool may give the following warning due to
path conversion errors:

```
libtool: link: Could not determine host file name corresponding to **
libtool: link: Continuing, but uninstalled executables may not work.
```

If so, examples and testsuite will have problems when run, showing an
error while loading shared libraries. To resolve, please run "make install".

# CyaSSL Release 2.6.0 (04/15/2013)

#### Release 2.6.0 CyaSSL has bug fixes and new features including:
- DTLS 1.2 support including AEAD ciphers
- SHA-3 finalist Blake2 support, it's fast and uses little resources
- SHA-384 cipher suites including ECC ones
- HMAC now supports SHA-512
- Track memory use for example client/server with -t option
- Better IPv6 examples with --enable-ipv6, before if ipv6 examples/tests were
  turned on, localhost only was used.  Now link-local (with scope ids) and ipv6
  hosts can be used as well.
- Xcode v4.6 project for iOS v6.1 update
- settings.h is now checked in all *.c files for true one file setting detection
- Better alignment at SSL layer for hardware crypto alignment needs
    * Note, SSL itself isn't friendly to alignment with 5 byte TLS headers and
      13 bytes DTLS headers, but every effort is now made to align with the
      CYASSL_GENERAL_ALIGNMENT flag which sets desired alignment requirement
- NO_64BIT flag to turn off 64bit data type accumulators in public key code
    * Note, some systems are faster with 32bit accumulators
- --enable-stacksize for example client/server stack use
    * Note, modern desktop Operating Systems may add bytes to each stack frame
- Updated compression/decompression with direct crypto access
- All ./configure options are now lowercase only for consistency
- ./configure builds default to fastmath option
    * Note, if on ia32 and building in shared mode this may produce a problem
      with a missing register being available because of PIC, there are at least
      6 solutions to this:
      1) --disable-fastmath , don't use fastmath
      2) --disable-shared, don't build a shared library
      3) C_EXTRA_FLAGS=-DTFM_NO_ASM , turn off assembly use
      4) use clang, it just seems to work
      5) play around with no PIC options to force all registers being open,
         e.g., --without-pic
      6) if static lib is still a problem try removing fPIE
- Many new ./configure switches for option enable/disable for example
    * rsa
    * dh
    * dsa
    * md5
    * sha
    * arc4
    * null    (allow NULL ciphers)
    * oldtls  (only use TLS 1.2)
    * asn     (no certs or public keys allowed)
- ./configure generates cyassl/options.h which allows a header the user can
  include in their app to make sure the same options are set at the app and
  CyaSSL level.
- autoconf no longer needs serial-tests which lowers version requirements of
  automake to 1.11 and autoconf to 2.63

# CyaSSL Release 2.5.0 (02/04/2013)

#### Release 2.5.0 CyaSSL has bug fixes and new features including:
- Fix for TLS CBC padding timing attack identified by Nadhem Alfardan and
  Kenny Paterson: http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/
- Microchip PIC32 (MIPS16, MIPS32) support
- Microchip MPLAB X example projects for PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit
- Updated CTaoCrypt benchmark app for embedded systems
- 1024-bit test certs/keys and cert/key buffers
- AES-CCM-8 crypto and cipher suites
- Camellia crypto and cipher suites
- Bumped minimum autoconf version to 2.65, automake version to 1.12
- Addition of OCSP callbacks
- STM32F2 support with hardware crypto and RNG
- Cavium NITROX support

CTaoCrypt now has support for the Microchip PIC32 and has been tested with
the Microchip PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit, the XC32 compiler and
MPLAB X IDE in both MIPS16 and MIPS32 instruction set modes. See the README
located under the <cyassl_root>/mplabx directory for more details.

To add Cavium NITROX support do:

./configure --with-cavium=/home/user/cavium/software

pointing to your licensed cavium/software directory.  Since Cavium doesn't
build a library we pull in the cavium_common.o file which gives a libtool
warning about the portability of this.  Also, if you're using the github source
tree you'll need to remove the -Wredundant-decls warning from the generated
Makefile because the cavium headers don't conform to this warning.  Currently
CyaSSL supports Cavium RNG, AES, 3DES, RC4, HMAC, and RSA directly at the crypto
layer.  Support at the SSL level is partial and currently just does AES, 3DES,
and RC4.  RSA and HMAC are slower until the Cavium calls can be utilized in non
blocking mode.  The example client turns on cavium support as does the crypto
test and benchmark.  Please see the HAVE_CAVIUM define.

CyaSSL is able to use the STM32F2 hardware-based cryptography and random number
generator through the STM32F2 Standard Peripheral Library. For necessary
defines, see the CYASSL_STM32F2 define in settings.h. Documentation for the
STM32F2 Standard Peripheral Library can be found in the following document:
http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/USER_MANUAL/DM00023896.pdf

# CyaSSL Release 1.6.5 (9/9/2010)

Release 1.6.5 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and x509 v3 self signed certificate
generation.

For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To enable certificate generation support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-certgen

An example is included in ctaocrypt/test/test.c and documentation is provided
in doc/CyaSSL_Extensions_Reference.pdf item 11.

# CyaSSL Release 1.6.0 (8/27/2010)

Release 1.6.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, RIPEMD-160, SHA-512, and RSA key
generation.

For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add RIPEMD-160 support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-ripemd

To add SHA-512 support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-sha512

To add RSA key generation support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-keygen

Please see ctaocrypt/test/test.c for examples and usage.

For Windows, RIPEMD-160 and SHA-512 are enabled by default but key generation is
off by default.  To turn key generation on add the define CYASSL_KEY_GEN to
CyaSSL.


# CyaSSL Release 1.5.6 (7/28/2010)

Release 1.5.6 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, compatibility for our JSSE provider,
and a fix for GCC builds on some systems.

For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add AES-NI support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-aesni

You'll need GCC 4.4.3 or later to make use of the assembly.

# CyaSSL Release 1.5.4 (7/7/2010)

Release 1.5.4 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, support for AES-NI, SHA1 speed
improvements from loop unrolling, and support for the Mongoose Web Server.

For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add AES-NI support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-aesni

You'll need GCC 4.4.3 or later to make use of the assembly.

# CyaSSL Release 1.5.0 (5/11/2010)

Release 1.5.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, GoAhead WebServer support, sniffer
support, and initial swig interface support.

For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add support for GoAhead WebServer either --enable-opensslExtra or if you
don't want all the features of opensslExtra you can just define GOAHEAD_WS
instead.  GOAHEAD_WS can be added to ./configure with CFLAGS=-DGOAHEAD_WS or
you can define it yourself.

To look at the sniffer support please see the sniffertest app in
sslSniffer/sslSnifferTest.  Build with --enable-sniffer on *nix or use the
vcproj files on windows.  You'll need to have pcap installed on *nix and
WinPcap on windows.

A swig interface file is now located in the swig directory for using Python,
Java, Perl, and others with CyaSSL.  This is initial support and experimental,
please send questions or comments to support@yassl.com.

When doing load testing with CyaSSL, on the echoserver example say, the client
machine may run out of tcp ephemeral ports, they will end up in the TIME_WAIT
queue, and can't be reused by default.  There are generally two ways to fix
this.

1. Reduce the length sockets remain on the TIME_WAIT queue OR
2. Allow items on the TIME_WAIT queue to be reused.


To reduce the TIME_WAIT length in OS X to 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds)

`sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=3000`

In Linux

`sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1`

allows reuse of sockets in TIME_WAIT

`sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1`

works but seems to remove sockets from  TIME_WAIT entirely?

`sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=1`

doesn't control TIME_WAIT, it controls FIN_WAIT(2) contrary to some posts


# CyaSSL Release 1.4.0 (2/18/2010)

Release 1.3.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, better multi TLS/SSL version support
through SSLv23_server_method(), and improved documentation in the doc/ folder.

For general build instructions doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

# CyaSSL Release 1.3.0 (1/21/2010)

Release 1.3.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, a potential security problem fix,
better porting support, removal of assert()s, and a complete THREADX port.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

# CyaSSL Release 1.2.0 (11/2/2009)

Release 1.2.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and session negotiation if first use is
read or write.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

# CyaSSL Release 1.1.0 (9/2/2009)

Release 1.1.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, a check against malicious session
cache use, support for lighttpd, and TLS 1.2.

To get TLS 1.2 support please use the client and server functions:

```c
SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_2_server_method(void);
SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_2_client_method(void);
```

CyaSSL was tested against lighttpd 1.4.23.  To build CyaSSL for use with
lighttpd use the following commands from the CyaSSL install dir <CyaSSLDir>:

```
./configure --disable-shared --enable-opensslExtra --enable-fastmath --without-zlib

make
make openssl-links
```

Then to build lighttpd with CyaSSL use the following commands from the
lighttpd install dir:

```
./configure --with-openssl --with-openssl-includes=<CyaSSLDir>/include --with-openssl-libs=<CyaSSLDir>/lib LDFLAGS=-lm

make
```

On some systems you may get a linker error about a duplicate symbol for
MD5_Init or other MD5 calls.  This seems to be caused by the lighttpd src file
md5.c, which defines MD5_Init(), and is included in liblightcomp_la-md5.o.
When liblightcomp is linked with the SSL_LIBs the linker may complain about
the duplicate symbol.  This can be fixed by editing the lighttpd src file md5.c
and adding this line to the beginning of the file:

\#if 0

and this line to the end of the file

\#endif

Then from the lighttpd src dir do a:

```
make clean
make
```

If you get link errors about undefined symbols more than likely the actual
OpenSSL libraries are found by the linker before the CyaSSL openssl-links that
point to the CyaSSL library, causing the linker confusion.  This can be fixed
by editing the Makefile in the lighttpd src directory and changing the line:

`SSL_LIB = -lssl -lcrypto`

to

`SSL_LIB = -lcyassl`

Then from the lighttpd src dir do a:

```
make clean
make
```

This should remove any confusion the linker may be having with missing symbols.

For any questions or concerns please contact support@yassl.com .

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

# CyaSSL Release 1.0.6 (8/03/2009)

Release 1.0.6 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, an improved session cache, and faster
math with a huge code option.

The session cache now defaults to a client mode, also good for embedded servers.
For servers not under heavy load (less than 200 new sessions per minute), define
BIG_SESSION_CACHE.  If the server will be under heavy load, define
HUGE_SESSION_CACHE.

There is now a fasthugemath option for configure.  This enables fastmath plus
even faster math by greatly increasing the code size of the math library. Use
the benchmark utility to compare public key operations.


For general build instructions see rc1 below.

# CyaSSL Release 1.0.3 (5/10/2009)

Release 1.0.3 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and add increased support for OpenSSL
compatibility when building other applications.

Release 1.0.3 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
aren't fully implemented at this time but will be for the next release.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

# CyaSSL Release 1.0.2 (4/3/2009)

Release 1.0.2 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes for a couple I/O issues.  Some systems
will send a SIGPIPE on socket recv() at any time and this should be handled by
the application by turning off SIGPIPE through setsockopt() or returning from
the handler.

Release 1.0.2 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
aren't fully implemented at this time but will be for the next release.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

## CyaSSL Release Candidate 3 rc3-1.0.0 (2/25/2009)


Release Candidate 3 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 adds bug fixes and adds a project file for
iPhone development with Xcode.  cyassl-iphone.xcodeproj is located in the root
directory.  This release also includes a fix for supporting other
implementations that bundle multiple messages at the record layer, this was
lost when cyassl i/o was re-implemented but is now fixed.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

## CyaSSL Release Candidate 2 rc2-1.0.0 (1/21/2009)


Release Candidate 2 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 adds bug fixes and adds two new stream
ciphers along with their respective cipher suites.  CyaSSL adds support for
HC-128 and RABBIT stream ciphers.  The new suites are:

```
TLS_RSA_WITH_HC_128_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_RABBIT_SHA
```

And the corresponding cipher names are

```
HC128-SHA
RABBIT-SHA
```

CyaSSL also adds support for building with devkitPro for PPC by changing the
library proper to use libogc.  The examples haven't been changed yet but if
there's interest they can be.  Here's an example ./configure to build CyaSSL
for devkitPro:

```
./configure --disable-shared CC=/pathTo/devkitpro/devkitPPC/bin/powerpc-gekko-gcc --host=ppc --without-zlib --enable-singleThreaded RANLIB=/pathTo/devkitpro/devkitPPC/bin/powerpc-gekko-ranlib CFLAGS="-DDEVKITPRO -DGEKKO"
```

For linking purposes you'll need

`LDFLAGS="-g -mrvl -mcpu=750 -meabi -mhard-float -Wl,-Map,$(notdir $@).map"`

For general build instructions see rc1 below.


## CyaSSL Release Candidate 1 rc1-1.0.0 (12/17/2008)


Release Candidate 1 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 contains major internal changes.  Several
areas have optimization improvements, less dynamic memory use, and the I/O
strategy has been refactored to allow alternate I/O handling or Library use.
Many thanks to Thierry Fournier for providing these ideas and most of the work.

Because of these changes, this release is only a candidate since some problems
are probably inevitable on some platform with some I/O use.  Please report any
problems and we'll try to resolve them as soon as possible.  You can contact us
at support@yassl.com or todd@yassl.com.

Using TomsFastMath by passing --enable-fastmath to ./configure now uses assembly
on some platforms.  This is new so please report any problems as every compiler,
mode, OS combination hasn't been tested.  On ia32 all of the registers need to
be available so be sure to pass these options to CFLAGS:

`CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer"`

OS X will also need -mdynamic-no-pic added to CFLAGS

Also if you're building in shared mode for ia32 you'll need to pass options to
LDFLAGS as well on OS X:

`LDFLAGS=-Wl,-read_only_relocs,warning`

This gives warnings for some symbols but seems to work.

# CyaSSL version 0.9.9 (7/25/2008)

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, Pre-Shared Keys, over-rideable memory
handling, and optionally TomsFastMath.  Thanks to Moisés Guimarães for the
work on TomsFastMath.

To optionally use TomsFastMath pass --enable-fastmath to ./configure
Or define USE_FAST_MATH in each project from CyaSSL for MSVC.

Please use the benchmark routine before and after to see the performance
difference, on some platforms the gains will be little but RSA encryption
always seems to be faster.  On x86-64 machines with GCC the normal math library
may outperform the fast one when using CFLAGS=-m64 because TomsFastMath can't
yet use -m64 because of GCCs inability to do 128bit division.

     *** UPDATE GCC 4.2.1 can now do 128bit division ***

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.9.8 (5/7/2008)

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, client side Diffie-Hellman, and better
socket handling.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.9.6 (1/31/2008)

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, increased session management, and a fix
for gnutls.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.9.0 (10/15/2007)

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, MSVC 2005 support, GCC 4.2 support,
IPV6 support and test, and new test certificates.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.8.0 (1/10/2007)

This release of CyaSSL adds increased socket support, for non-blocking writes,
connects, and interrupted system calls.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.6.3 (10/30/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds debug logging to stderr to aid in the debugging of
CyaSSL on systems that may not provide the best support.

If CyaSSL is built with debugging support then you need to call
CyaSSL_Debugging_ON() to turn logging on.

On Unix use ./configure --enable-debug

On Windows define DEBUG_CYASSL when building CyaSSL


To turn logging back off call CyaSSL_Debugging_OFF()

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.6.2 (10/29/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds TLS 1.1.

Note that CyaSSL has certificate verification on by default, unlike OpenSSL.
To emulate OpenSSL behavior, you must call SSL_CTX_set_verify() with
SSL_VERIFY_NONE.  In order to have full security you should never do this,
provide CyaSSL with the proper certificates to eliminate impostors and call
CyaSSL_check_domain_name() to prevent man in the middle attacks.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.

# CyaSSL version 0.6.0 (10/25/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds more SSL functions, better autoconf, nonblocking
I/O for accept, connect, and read.  There is now an --enable-small configure
option that turns off TLS, AES, DES3, HMAC, and ERROR_STRINGS, see configure.in
for the defines.  Note that TLS requires HMAC and AES requires TLS.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.5.5 (09/27/2006)

This mini release of CyaSSL adds better input processing through buffered input
and big message support.  Added SSL_pending() and some sanity checks on user
settings.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.5.0 (03/27/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds AES support and minor bug fixes.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.4.0 (03/15/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds TLSv1 client/server support and libtool.

See notes below for build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.3.0 (02/26/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds SSLv3 server support and session resumption.

See notes below for build instructions.


# CyaSSL version 0.2.0 (02/19/2006)


This is the first release of CyaSSL and its crypt brother, CTaoCrypt.  CyaSSL
is written in ANSI C with the idea of a small code size, footprint, and memory
usage in mind.  CTaoCrypt can be as small as 32K, and the current client
version of CyaSSL can be as small as 12K.


The first release of CTaoCrypt supports MD5, SHA-1, 3DES, ARC4, Big Integer
Support, RSA, ASN parsing, and basic x509 (en/de)coding.

The first release of CyaSSL supports normal client RSA mode SSLv3 connections
with support for SHA-1 and MD5 digests.  Ciphers include 3DES and RC4.

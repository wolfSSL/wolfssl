# RT-Thread Port
## Overview
You can enable the wolfSSL support for RT-Thread available [here](https://www.rt-thread.io) using the define `RTTHREAD`.

## Usage

wolfSSL supports a compile-time user configurable options in the `IDE/ECLIPSE/RTTHREAD/user_settings.h` file.

The `wolfssl_test.c` example application provides a simple function to run the test and benchmark.

1. Open your IDE-based example project for RT-Thread.

2. Create the following folder and sub-folders structures in your project.
```
wolfssl
   |src
   |wolfcrypt
          |benchmark
          |src
          |test
   |wolfssl
          |openssl
          |wolfcrypt
   |example
```
The folder hierarchy is the same as the wolfSSL folders with an exception of the example folder.

3. Add or link all of the header and source files in `IDE/ECLIPSE/RTTHREAD/` folder into the example folder.

4. Add or link all the source code in the corresponding folder in wolfSSL.

5. Remove non-C platform dependent files from your build.

6. In your C/C++ compiler preprocessor settings, add the wolfSSL directories to your include paths.
Here's an example of the paths that must be added.

```
$PROJ_DIR$\...
$PROJ_DIR$\...\wolfcrypt
$PROJ_DIR$\...\wolfssl
$PROJ_DIR$\...\IDE\ECLIPSE\RTTHREAD
```

7. In your C/C++ compiler preprocessor settings, define the WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS symbol to add user_settings.h file in your project.

8. Add a call to `wolfssl_test()` from your startup task. Here's an example:

```c
static void test_task (void *p_arg)
{
    ...
    while (1) {
           wolfssl_test();
           rt_thread_mdelay(500);
        }
}
```
9. Rebuild all your project.

10. Now you are ready to download and debug your image on the board.


The test results below were collected from the RT-Thread ART-Pi with the following software and tool chains:

- STM32H750XBH6

- RT-Thread Studio (Version: 2.0.0)

- GNU ARM Cross C Compiler (Optimization level: -O0)

- The starting project is based on [RT-Thread ART-Pi SDK](https://github.com/RT-Thread-Studio/sdk-bsp-stm32h750-realthread-artpi) (./projects/art_pi_wifi)

- wolfssl [latest version](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl)

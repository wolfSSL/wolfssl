  # 2. Build TOPPERS library
  
  2-1.To build the Toppers library, download [asp-1.9.3 Renesas BSP version] from [https://www.toppers.jp/asp-d-download.html] and download [/wolfssl/ IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RX72N/EnvisionKit_Toppers/]
  
  2-2.To build the Toppers library, download [Configurator Release 1.9.6 (binary for Windows)] from [https://www.toppers.jp/cfg-download.html] and unzip it with [2.1] Create a [cfg/cfg] directory in the [asp] directory and extract it as [cfg.exe] inside
  
  2-3.Execute the shell script shown below to apply the patch.
    (Copy the files necessary for using EDMAC)
```
  $ pwd [Individual installation environment]/wolfssl/IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RX72N/EnvisionKit_Toppers
  ./setting.sh
```

  2-4. Confirmation of advance preparation

    Please prepare an environment such as Msys2 in advance for command execution.
    Install the gcc toolchain with Msys2.
    In the Msys2 environment, it is necessary to set the path of the Renesas environment in advance.bashrc etc.

--- Here is a setting example: Specify the Renesas toolchain path ---

```
$ export PATH=PATH=$PATH:\/C/ProgramData\/GCC\ for\ Renesas\ RX\ 8.3.0.202202-GNURX-ELF/rx-elf/rx-elf/bin
```

2-5. After confirming the settings, do the following

```
$ pwd [Individual installation environment]/wolfssl/IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RX72N/EnvisionKit_Toppers/asp
$ perl ./configure -T rx72n_gcc
$ make depend
```

  2-6. Project [Properties] → [C/C++ Build] → [Environment] dialog [Environment variable to set] [Add] button, enter [C_PROJECT] in [Name:] in [New variable] dialog , enter ${ProjDirPath} for [Value:]  
  
  2-7. Select [Open Project from File System...] in the menu

  2-8. Select [Toppers_app] from the git repository wolfssl/IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RX72N/EnvisionKit_Toppers Press [Select Folder]　　

  2-9. Click the created project in Project Explorer and select the [Build Project (B)] key from the pull-down menu to build.

  2-10.[toppers_rx] will generate [libasp.a]
 
# 3. Build the wolfSSLDemo project

  3-1. Select [Open Project from File System...] in the menu

  3-2. Select [wolfSSLDemo] from the git repository wolfssl/IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RX72N/EnvisionKit_Toppers Press [Select Folder]

  (If you cannot use the patch command with Msys2, you need to install it with [pacman -S patch])
  do the following
  ```
$pwd
[Individual installation environment]/wolfssl/IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RX72N/EnvisionKit_Toppers/WolfSSLDemo
  patch --binary -p0 < ./bsp.patch
```
Note:  
If you have used the smart configurator to generate code for [r_bsp],[r_cmt_rx], you will need to reapply the patch  
  
  3-8.[3-1.] After completion, select the [Build Project (B)] key from the pull-down menu to build.  
  3-9. Transfer the ELF file generated by the build to the board with [Menu] → [Run (R)] → [Run (R)] or [Debug (D)] and execute it

The wolfSSL examples in the WICED SDK require a server application. wolfSSL
provides an easy solution in the <wolfSSL root>/examples/ directory. Run the autogen
script and configure the library with necessary functionality, see ./configure -h for a
list of configure options. Finally, run make and make check to ensure the
library build was successfull. You can install wolfSSL on your system with make
install if you wish. See www.wolfssl.com/docs/ for more information.

Run ./examples/server/server -h for a list of server options. If you would like
to test the server, you may run the client against it using your localhost. An
example of how to run the server:
        ./examples/server/server -b -d -r -p 50007 <IP>

Download and install WICED Studio from the Cypress website.

The necessary files are located in the <wolfSSL_root>/IDE/WICED-STUDIO/ directory.
These files will be described in the following setup proceedure to get you started
with any TLS project.

Once you have installed the WICED software:
    1. Create a directory called 'wolfssl_lib.' The path should be:
                43xxx_Wi-Fi/WICED/security/BESL/wolfssl_lib.
    3. Drop in or link the wolfSSL library into the wolfssl_lib directory you
       just created.
    4. The user_settings.h file in the IDE/WICED-STUDIO/ directory should be place
       at <wolfssl_root>. This file provides the configure options for compiling
       wolfSSL with your project. The default values will give you a starting point 
       and you may further configure the library.
    5. The wolfssl_lib.mk should be placed at the same level as the wolfSSL
        library within wolfssl_lib. The directory structure should be
            WICED/security/BESL/wolfssl_lib/<wolfssl_root>      and
            WICED/security/BESL/wolfssl_lib/wolfssl_lib.mk.
    6. Copy the snippets into the apps/snip/ directory.
    7. Apply the patches to the proper files.
    
You can now build and use the wolfSSL and wolfCrypt snips within the WICED SDK.
Cypress includes great documentation and getting started videos to learn how to
build and run the snips.

wolfSSL provides a wolfCrypt test application, a TLS client and server application, 
and an HTTPS client application. Future development and additions will be made.

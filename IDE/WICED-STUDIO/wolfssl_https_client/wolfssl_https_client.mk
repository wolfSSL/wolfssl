# this application shows the functionality of using a chain buffer.
# If you want to see other options, refer to www.wolfssl.com/docs for further
# API functions involving the use of certificate verification. You may further
# configure these APIs in the file wiced_tls.c for use with PEM or DER certificates.
# Turn on if you are using a chain and turn off if you are using a single cert.

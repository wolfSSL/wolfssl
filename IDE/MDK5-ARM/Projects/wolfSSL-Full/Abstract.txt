This program gives  wolfCrypt and CyaSSL library demo.

In order to run the demo,
Copy {PACK}\wolfSSL\CyaSSL\{version}\cyassl\certs folder and files to the SD memory.
For demo configuration, refer config-Crypt.h and config-CyaSSL.h.

After download and start the execution, you can type in commands through the
Debug(printf) viewer.

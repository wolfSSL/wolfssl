#
# Main component makefile.
#
# This Makefile can be left empty. By default, it will take the sources in the
# src/ directory, compile them and link them into lib(subdirectory_name).a
# in the build directory. This behavior is entirely configurable,
# please read the ESP-IDF documents if you need to do this.
#
# (Uses default behavior of compiling all source files in directory, adding 'include' to include path.)
